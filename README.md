# Drone Monitoring Dashboard

A web-based dashboard for monitoring and managing drone data efficiently.  
This project consists of two main parts:

- **Assignment 1 (Backend)**: Drone Log Server using Express.js
- **Assignment 2 (Frontend)**: Drone Monitoring Dashboard using Next.js

## Overview

The system allows users to:

- View the configuration of a specific drone.
- Log temperature data from the drone.
- View and navigate historical logs with pagination.

## UI Design

All user interface layouts and components were **personally designed by me** using **Figma** before the development stage.  
This ensured that the web application has a consistent and modern design.
